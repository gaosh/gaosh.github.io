The curriculum is divided into two main sections: Low-level Vision and High-level Vision. Low-level Vision focuses on classical computer vision methods for extracting basic visual features, and High-level Vision covers more recent advances of computer vision by incoperating deep neural networks to perform complex tasks.</p> <h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2> <p><a href="https://szeliski.org/Book/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, 2nd ed.</em></a></p> <p><strong>Authors</strong>: Richard Szeliski</p> <p><a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Deep Learning</em></a></p> <p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville</p> <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2> <p>Grading Grading will be based on the following components: Homework assignments (3 assignments x 10% each = 30%) Project (15% first presentation + 15% second presentation = 30%)</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Homework Assignments (45%)</strong> (3 assignments x 15% each = 45%)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>First Project (20%)</strong>: The first project will be a from scratch implementation of deep neural networks using a language of your choice. No auto-differentiation package (like Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.) is allowed to use for this project.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Second Project (25%)</strong>: The second project does not have a specific topic. A good project should either propose a new method for addressing an existing problem or apply techniques we‚Äôve studied in class (or other relevant methods) to a new, unaddressed problem. A borderline project will simply reimplement existing works. Given the GPU-intensive nature of modern computer vision research, we will aim to secure AWS education credits to support your projects. Additionally, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/blob/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial2/Introduction_to_PyTorch.ipynb" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Google Colab</strong></a> is available as an option for an easier start.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Students are encouraged to work in groups of three for their final project. You are strongly encouraged to present a project proposal to the instructor during one office hours session. Please use visual aids (e.g., bring slides/figures/tables, and/or draw on the whiteboard during the conversation). The project proposal discussion should occur before the date indicated in the schedule. This component is not graded.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Participation and Quizs (10%)</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>üéÅ <strong>Extra Bonus</strong>: (1) Students are highly encouraged to prepare for submissions to <a href="https://aideadlin.es/?sub=CV,ML" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>major CV/ML conferences</strong></a> based on their projects. Please be sure to make an appointment with the instructor prior to any submission plans to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the research topic. Each submission <u>under the instructor's recognition</u> will gain <strong><u>6 points</u></strong> on their final grades; (2) Students are highly encouraged to provide feedback on the development of this course. At the end of this semester, <u>a feedback survey completion rate exceeding 70%</u> will lead to an additional <strong><u>3 points</u></strong> for everyone enrolled in this class.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Date</th> <th>Topic</th> <th>Materials</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>8.27 (Tuesday)</td> <td rowspan="3">Introduction</td> <td rowspan="3"></td> <td rowspan="3"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>8.29 (Thursday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.3 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.5 (Thursday)</td> <td rowspan="3">Filtering and texture</td> <td rowspan="3"></td> <td rowspan="3"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.10 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.12 (Thursday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.17 (Tuesday)</td> <td rowspan="3">Feature detection and description</td> <td rowspan="3"></td> <td rowspan="3"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.19 (Thursday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.24 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.26 (Thursday)</td> <td rowspan="2">Edges, lines, circles and segment</td> <td rowspan="2"></td> <td rowspan="2"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.31 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.3 (Thursday)</td> <td rowspan="2">Multiple views</td> <td rowspan="2"></td> <td rowspan="2"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.8 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.10 (Thursday)</td> <td rowspan="3">Intro to recognition</td> <td rowspan="3"></td> <td rowspan="3"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.15 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.17 (Thursday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.22 (Tuesday)</td> <td>Pytorch and Google Colab Tutorial</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.24 (Thursday)</td> <td rowspan="3">Convolutional neural networks</td> <td rowspan="3"></td> <td rowspan="3"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.29 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10.31 (Thursday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.5 (Tuesday)</td> <td rowspan="2">Object recognition, detection, segmentation</td> <td rowspan="2"></td> <td rowspan="2"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.7 (Thursday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.12 (Tuesday)</td> <td rowspan="3">Vision and language, video and motion</td> <td rowspan="3"></td> <td rowspan="3"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.14 (Thursday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.19 (Tuesday)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.21 (Thursday)</td> <td>Unsupervised learning</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.26 (Tuesday)</td> <td>Self-supervised learning</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>11.28 (Thursday)</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>üèñÔ∏è No class.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.3 (Tuesday)</td> <td>Efficient Vision</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.5 (Thursday)</td> <td><strong>Project Presentation</strong></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.10 (Tuesday)</td> <td><strong>Project Presentation</strong></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.14 (Thursday)</td> <td><strong>Project Presentation</strong></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.15 (Friday)</td> <td>üö® Project DDL at 23:59 PM (AoE)</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>Not a class day.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2> <p><strong>Grade of ‚ÄúI‚Äù Policy:</strong> Incomplete (‚ÄúI‚Äù) grades should be recorded only in exceptional cases when a student, who has completed a substantial portion of the course and who is otherwise passing, is unable to complete a well-defined portion of a course for reasons beyond the student‚Äôs control. Students in these circumstances must petition the instructor and should be prepared to present documentation that substantiates their case.</p> <p><strong>University Attendance Policy</strong>: Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holidays, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.</p> <p><strong>Academic Honor Policy:</strong> The Florida State University, Academic Honor Policy, outlines the University‚Äôs expectations for the integrity of student‚Äôs academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to . . . be honest and truthful and . . . [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University. (Florida State University Academic Honor Policy, found at http://fda.fsu.edu/Academics/Academic-Honor-Policy).</p> <p>For this course, in particular, every student must complete his/her assignments, quizzes, and exams independently. Showing your work to your peers or making it accessible to them is considered academic dishonesty. You are responsible for ensuring that your work is adequately protected and not accessible to others.</p> <p><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act:</strong> Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should: (1) register with and provide documentation to the Office of Accessibility Services; (2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for accommodation and what type; (3) meet (in person, via phone, email, skype, zoom, etc‚Ä¶) with each instructor to whom a letter of accommodation was sent to review approved accommodations. Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from the Office of Accessibility Services has been provided.
