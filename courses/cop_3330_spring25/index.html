These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid written excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.</p> <p><strong>Academic Honor Policy:</strong> The Florida State University, Academic Honor Policy, outlines the University‚Äôs expectations for the integrity of student‚Äôs academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to . . . be honest and truthful and . . . [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University. (Florida State University Academic Honor Policy, found at http://fda.fsu.edu/Academics/Academic-Honor-Policy).</p> <p><strong>All work in this course is intended to be done individually.</strong> In addition to this information, please be aware of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>It is NOT APPROPRIATE</strong> to utilize websites such as <strong>CHEGG.com</strong>, <strong>COURSEHERO.com</strong>, etc. <strong>DO NOT</strong> post our assignments to these websites to solicit answers, and <strong>DO NOT</strong> use/view/utilize the ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù found on these websites. Doing so is in direct violation of the FSU honor policy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>It is NOT APPROPRIATE</strong> to work on assignments with other students or to give or receive solutions to or from anyone before an assignment is due and handed in (by all parties).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>It is NOT APPROPRIATE</strong> to share any amount of code with your classmates. When you turn in code with your name on it, you are representing that work as your own. If your submission matches that of another student, this is considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>It is NOT APPROPRIATE</strong> to copy/paste or use any amount of code written by other people from any web sources, forums, etc., as your own solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>It is NOT APPROPRIATE</strong> to post your code online in public view, where other students can copy it. If I find your code online (unapproved online compilers, text sites, blogs, help sites, etc.), no matter the intent in posting your code, this is automatically in violation of the Academic Honor Policy. The appropriate actions will be taken. If you are keeping code on repositories like GitHub, make sure your code is not searchable or viewable by the public.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Plagiarism detection tools</strong>, such as <strong>MOSS</strong>, will be used in the grading process.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>It IS APPROPRIATE</strong> to utilize examples found in the course textbook or in the course notes and examples, as long as the source is cited. This is appropriate because some hand-in assignments will have structural elements based on examples we‚Äôve done in class or contain other code provided to you in the assignment specification.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>It IS APPROPRIATE</strong> to discuss solutions and techniques on assignments with other students <strong>AFTER</strong> the assignment has been graded and handed back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>It IS APPROPRIATE</strong> to study general topics, ideas, and solve non-assigned-for-homework questions for practice with other classmates.</p> </li> <li> <p>If it is found that a student has violated the academic honor policy, the student is <strong>not permitted to drop or withdraw</strong> from the course and must complete the course with the sanctions assessed via the policy. This is a <strong>UNIVERSITY</strong> policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>first violation</strong> of the honor code will result, at minimum (but not limited to), in a penalty of <strong>0</strong> on the assignment or test involved, along with a <strong>reduced course letter grade</strong> for that term (‚Äì10 points off the final course grade).</p> </li> <li> <p>If the violation is that of <strong>soliciting solutions on external web sites</strong> (Chegg, Course Hero, etc.) ‚Äî which is also a violation of copyright ‚Äî the penalty will be an <strong>automatic F</strong> in the course, regardless of whether it is a first violation or not.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any <strong>second violation</strong> of the honor code will result in an <strong>automatic F</strong> in the course, and possible proceedings before the FSU Honor Code Committee.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Academic success:</strong> Your academic success is a top priority at Florida State University.
