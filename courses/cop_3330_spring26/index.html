Simply reading the code aloud will not receive points. 2. **A demonstration of the application** - Show the application from the user’s perspective and highlight any bugs you intend to resolve. 3. **An explanation of anything that isn’t currently working** - Discuss how you plan to address the issue. 4. **Reflection on the most difficult part of the assignment** - Explain how you worked through the challenge. Video links should be added as a comment on the submission. **Do not** upload video files to Canvas. **Do not** include the link in your code submission. ## Late Assignments The course schedule shows the general timing of assignments to assist you in staying on track. Assignments will be accepted up to **three days** late for a **15% penalty**. Assignments will be accepted after the late deadline with an excuse on a case-by-case basis. **Note** that after solutions are posted, any assignments accepted past that point will be subject to requirements modifications, resulting in a different assignment than the original. It is in your best interest to let me know **ASAP** if you will miss a deadline (with an excuse) so we can be proactive. ## Final Grades <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Grade</th> <th>Range</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>A</td> <td>93–100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>A-</td> <td>90–92</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B+</td> <td>87–89</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B</td> <td>83–86</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B-</td> <td>80–82</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C+</td> <td>77–79</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C</td> <td>73–76</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C-</td> <td>70–72</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D+</td> <td>67–69</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D</td> <td>63–66</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D-</td> <td>60–62</td> </tr> <tr> <td>F</td> <td>0–59</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> **Course Attendance Policy:** Attendance is merged with participation, and attendance will be measured by in-class or recitation quizzes. **University Attendance Policy:** Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid written excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness. **Academic Honor Policy:** The Florida State University, Academic Honor Policy, outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of student’s academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to . . . be honest and truthful and . . . [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University. (Florida State University Academic Honor Policy, found at http://fda.fsu.edu/Academics/Academic-Honor-Policy). **All work in this course is intended to be done individually.** In addition to this information, please be aware of the following: - **It is NOT APPROPRIATE** to utilize websites such as **CHEGG.com**, **COURSEHERO.com**, etc. **DO NOT** post our assignments to these websites to solicit answers, and **DO NOT** use/view/utilize the “solutions” found on these websites. Doing so is in direct violation of the FSU honor policy. - **It is NOT APPROPRIATE** to work on assignments with other students or to give or receive solutions to or from anyone before an assignment is due and handed in (by all parties). - **It is NOT APPROPRIATE** to share any amount of code with your classmates. When you turn in code with your name on it, you are representing that work as your own. If your submission matches that of another student, this is considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code. - **It is NOT APPROPRIATE** to copy/paste or use any amount of code written by other people from any web sources, forums, etc., as your own solutions. - **It is NOT APPROPRIATE** to post your code online in public view, where other students can copy it. If I find your code online (unapproved online compilers, text sites, blogs, help sites, etc.), no matter the intent in posting your code, this is automatically in violation of the Academic Honor Policy. The appropriate actions will be taken. If you are keeping code on repositories like GitHub, make sure your code is not searchable or viewable by the public. - **Plagiarism detection tools**, such as **MOSS**, will be used in the grading process. - **It IS APPROPRIATE** to utilize examples found in the course textbook or in the course notes and examples, as long as the source is cited. This is appropriate because some hand-in assignments will have structural elements based on examples we’ve done in class or contain other code provided to you in the assignment specification. - **It IS APPROPRIATE** to discuss solutions and techniques on assignments with other students **AFTER** the assignment has been graded and handed back. - **It IS APPROPRIATE** to study general topics, ideas, and solve non-assigned-for-homework questions for practice with other classmates. - If it is found that a student has violated the academic honor policy, the student is **not permitted to drop or withdraw** from the course and must complete the course with the sanctions assessed via the policy. This is a **UNIVERSITY** policy. - A **first violation** of the honor code will result, at minimum (but not limited to), in a penalty of **0** on the assignment or test involved, along with a **reduced course letter grade** for that term (–10 points off the final course grade). - If the violation is that of **soliciting solutions on external web sites** (Chegg, Course Hero, etc.) — which is also a violation of copyright — the penalty will be an **automatic F** in the course, regardless of whether it is a first violation or not. - Any **second violation** of the honor code will result in an **automatic F** in the course, and possible proceedings before the FSU Honor Code Committee. **Academic success:** Your academic success is a top priority at Florida State University. The university provides a range of resources to help you succeed, including tutoring centers, computer labs, counseling and health services, and services for designated groups—such as veterans and students with disabilities. The following information is not exhaustive, so please check with your advisor or the Dean of Students office to learn more. **Americans with Disabilities Act:** Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should: (1) register with and provide documentation to the Office of Accessibility Services; (2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for accommodation and what type; (3) meet (in person, via phone, email, skype, zoom, etc...) with each instructor to whom a letter of accommodation was sent to review approved accommodations. Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from the Office of Accessibility Services has been provided.
