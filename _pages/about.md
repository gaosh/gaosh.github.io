I am now a final year Ph.D. candidate in ECE, Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Prof. Heng Huang. I am also a Research Scientist at Samsung Research America. Prior to that, I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer System Engineering at Northeastern University in 2017, and I obtained my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering at Xidian University in 2015.

My research interests includes: 
<ul>
    <li>Scalable Machine Learning:  Model compression for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Differentiable Neural Architecture Search. </li>
    <li>Efficient and Safe Cross-Modal Learning: Adversarial attack and defense on cross-modal datas. Efficient vision and language transformers and cross-domain CNNs. </li>
    <li>Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning: Variance-reduced policy gradient methods based on momentum techniques and mirror descent.</li>
	<li>Zeroth-order optimization methods and other topics for optimization. Fairness in deep learning and interpretation guided models.</li>
</ul>

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
